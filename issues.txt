Issues with this version:

*When reloading the page the images come back to their initial state 
and doesn't sync. 

*For the moment I can't use gpio shell commands to read an input on the gpio 
then serve it on the webpage.

*So this Method is only for controlling outputs.

*for reading inputs you might want to use flask or node js

*The only input here is the webcam video streaming
